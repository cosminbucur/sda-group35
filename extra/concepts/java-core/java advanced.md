### oop (object-oriented programming)

1. use diagrams.net (https://www.diagrams.net/) and create "building blocks" with concepts for the following topics

        git

2. read about UML 2 (unified modeling language)

   https://sparxsystems.com/resources/tutorials/uml2/class-diagram.html

3. create a UML class diagram for each of the following concepts:

        inheritance (IS-A)
        aggregation (HAS-A) 
        composition (HAS-A) restrictive
        association
        
        encapsulation
        abstract classes
        interfaces
        polymorphism

4. write code to prove the concepts in the UML diagrams using the guidelines:

- use encapsulation (private fields, getters + setters)
- use inheritance (create at least 2 levels of inheritance, eg: Grandparent, Parent, Child)
- use aggregation (use an object inside another object)
- use default constructor and constructor with multiple parameters
- use "this" keyword in methods
- use "super" keyword in constructor and methods
- extract common methods in an abstract class (extend it with at least 2 classes)
- define an interface (implement it in at least 2 classes)
- create a class that extends an abstract class and implements 2 interfaces
- prove polymorphism using an abstract class and two implementations

### generic types

- write a generic class that can take any type of object (set an object using constructor or setter)
- write a generic class with a restrictive type

## collections

- create a diagram with the collections hierarchy
- use as many operations as possible with the following collections
  (consider CRUD create, read, update, delete)

### list

- transform a list to an array
- iterate using all methods:

        iterator
        for
        enhanced for

- sort list using comparator
- sort list using Comparator class (with lambda)

### set

- iterate set

### map

- iterate a map
- get the keys from a map
- get the values from a map

### optional
- write an optional
- write an empty optional
- write methods that return optional
- use orElseGet() and orElseThrow()
